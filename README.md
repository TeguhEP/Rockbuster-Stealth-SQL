## Description
Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a movie rental company that previously had physical stores around the globe, is looking to launch an online video rental service to remain competitive against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime. As a data analyst, my primary task is to load all of Rockbuster's data into a relational database management system (RDBMS) and use SQL to analyze the data. My findings will be used to answer a series of key business questions posed by the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board, including which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain, the average rental duration for all videos, the countries where Rockbuster customers are based, where customers with high lifetime value are located, and whether sales figures vary between geographic regions. Ultimately, I will present my analysis easily.
