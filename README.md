# Rockbuster-Stealth-SQL
## Description
Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a movie rental company that previously had physical stores around the globe, is looking to launch an online video rental service to remain competitive against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime. As a data analyst, my primary task is to load all of Rockbuster's data into a relational database management system (RDBMS) and use SQL to analyze the data. 
## Key Questions
My findings will be used to answer a series of key business questions posed by the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board, including:  
1. Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
2. What was the average rental duration for all videos?
3. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
4. Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
5. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
